// How do you improve?
// 1. Devise a plan for solving problems
// 2. Master common problem solving patterns

// Devise a plan for solving problems:
//  - Understand the problem
//  - Explore concrete examples
//  - Break it down
//  - Solve/Simplify
//  - Look back and refactor

// Understand the problem
//  - Can I restate the problem in my own words?
//  - What are the inputs?
//  - What are the outputs?
//  - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
//  - Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
//  - How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

// Explore concrete examples
//  - Simple examples
//  - More complex examples
//  - Empty inputs
//  - Invalid inputs

// Break it down
//  - Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

// Solve/Simplify
//  - Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
//  - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
//  - Write a simplified solution
//  - Then incorporate that difficulty back in

// Look back and refactor
//  - Can you check the result?
//  - Can you improve the performance of your solution?
//  - Can you think of other ways to refactor?
//  - How have other people solved this problem?
